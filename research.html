                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper analyzes the effect of exposure to foreign mass media on environmental awareness and pro-environmental behavior. We exploit a natural experiment occurring in the German Democratic Republic, where geographic characteristics determined the reception of Western TV. Western media provided information on environmental pollution, a topic censored in East German state media. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), we find a positive and persistent effect of Western TV exposure on environmental awareness and the likelihood of participating in environmental organizations...</p>

                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Television is a major spare-time activity with the potential to lower economic activity but also to manipulate behavior by changing preferences and social norms through role models. To provide a comprehensive investigation into the impacts of television on the labor market, we study two natural experiments providing variation in access to television broadcasts. First, we leverage a setting in West Germany, where individuals in some regions could watch commercial television via terrestrial frequencies while others could only watch public TV...</p>

                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study investigates a neglected determinant of adolescents’ dietary behaviors: the within-class age difference, in isolation from confounding factors (e.g., absolute age, season-of-birth, and countries’ specific characteristics, such as expected age at school start). We study a multi-country dataset, with more than 500k students from dozens of very diverse countries. We find that the youngest students in a class have worse dietary behaviors; they are more likely to be overweight, they eat fewer vegetables and fruits...</p>
