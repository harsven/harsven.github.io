                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper analyzes the effect of exposure to foreign mass media on environmental awareness and pro-environmental behavior. We exploit a natural experiment occurring in the German Democratic Republic, where geographic characteristics determined the reception of Western TV. Western media provided information on environmental pollution, a topic censored in East German state media. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), we find a positive and persistent effect of Western TV exposure on environmental awareness and the likelihood of participating in environmental organizations. The analysis of survey data conducted before the fall of the Iron Curtain supports these findings. By examining county-level data, we show that Western TV induced individuals to submit complaint letters related to environmental protection to local authorities. Moreover, regions that could receive Western TV exhibited higher electoral outcomes for the Green Party in the first two federal elections of reunified Germany.</p>

                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Television is a major spare-time activity with the potential to lower economic activity but also to manipulate behavior by changing preferences and social norms through role models. To provide a comprehensive investigation into the impacts of television on the labor market, we study two natural experiments providing variation in access to television broadcasts. First, we leverage a setting in West Germany, where individuals in some regions could watch commercial television via terrestrial frequencies while others could only watch public TV. By analyzing rich panel data, we provide evidence inconsistent with the notion of negative impacts on labor market outcomes. Instead, we find positive effects on the labor supply among females. This employment premium has limited monetary consequences for females, which could be due to gender-specific occupational choices...</p>

                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study investigates a neglected determinant of adolescents’ dietary behaviors: the within-class age difference, in isolation from confounding factors (e.g., absolute age, season-of-birth, and countries’ specific characteristics, such as expected age at school start). We study a multi-country dataset, with more than 500k students from dozens of very diverse countries. We find that the youngest students in a class have worse dietary behaviors; they are more likely to be overweight, they eat fewer vegetables and fruits, they eat more sweets and drink more soft drinks...</p>
