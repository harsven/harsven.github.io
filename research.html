            <h2>Fog or Smog? The Impact of Uncensored Reporting on Pollution</h2>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper analyzes the effect of exposure to foreign mass media on environmental awareness and pro-environmental behavior. We exploit a natural experiment occurring in the German Democratic Republic, where geographic characteristics determined the reception of Western TV. Western media provided information on environmental pollution, a topic censored in East German state media. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), we find a positive and persistent effect of Western TV exposure on environmental awareness and the likelihood of participating in environmental organizations. The analysis of survey data conducted before the fall of the Iron Curtain supports these findings. By examining county-level data, we show that Western TV induced individuals to submit complaint letters related to environmental protection to local authorities. Moreover, regions that could receive Western TV exhibited higher electoral outcomes for the Green Party in the first two federal elections of reunified Germany.</p>
